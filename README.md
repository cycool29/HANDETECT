# HANDETECT
An innovative AI-powered handwriting analysis system to achieve early detection and monitoring of movement disorders

Welcome to the HANDETECT Project! Our goal is to develop an innovative AI-powered system that facilitates early detection and monitoring of movement disorders through handwriting assessment. We are excited to embark on this journey and contribute to the advancement of medical research in this field.

## About Movement Disorders
Movement disorders encompass a wide range of neurological conditions that affect the ability to control voluntary and involuntary movements. These conditions can lead to difficulties in handwriting and other motor-related tasks. Through our research, we aim to improve the understanding of movement disorders and enable early intervention for better patient outcomes.

## Our Approach
Our unique approach involves analyzing handwriting patterns to detect subtle motor abnormalities associated with movement disorders. By administering a series of simple drawing tasks, we can gather valuable data that may aid in the identification and tracking of various movement disorders.

## Participate in our Project
We welcome participants who have been diagnosed with movement disorders to take part in our handwriting assessment. The assessment involves drawing various patterns, such as the Archimedes Spiral, Simple House, Running Stickman, Simple Wave Curves, L-Loops, Straight Lines, and Simple Car.

## Data Privacy and Confidentiality
We understand the importance of data privacy and confidentiality. Rest assured, all participant data will be treated with the utmost care and stored securely. Personal information will be anonymized to protect participants' identities.

## Collaboration Opportunities
We are open to collaborating with medical professionals, research institutions, and patient organizations dedicated to movement disorders. If you are interested in partnering with us or have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
